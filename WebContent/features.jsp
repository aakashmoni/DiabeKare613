Software
<p>
Allow the patient to customize features such as alarms, visual display, and degree of complexity so that the device can be matched to the patient's capabilities, needs, and limitations.
Provide variable volume settings and tones for alarms.
Provide menus that are more intuitively obvious.
Standardize data formats.
Enable automatic time synchronization between pumps and other medical devices such as meters and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
Solve the time discrepancy issues in the same way a cell phone does.
Design insulin pumps or CGMs to allow data input regarding diet, exercise, and stress.
Build a graphic bolus counter instead of just using beep sounds to confirm exactly how many doses a patient has received.
Install an antistacking feature. This would be useful because users look at only the most recent bolus. This feature would allow the clinician to make decisions with the patient to prevent stacking and hypoglycemia.
Use the cell phone camera to count carbohydrates.
Improve accuracy of pumps to deliver programmed doses of insulin.
Provide graphs of downloaded glucose levels from BG monitors and CGMs.
Allocate an area for the patient and the physician to enter comments in the electronic logs that are available for download.
Make software more available and reasonably priced for the public. Proprietary issues increase the cost of everything.
Improve the accuracy of the pump's communication with the meter and CGM.
<p>

Hardware
<p>
Produce devices with stronger vibrations.
Use color in displays and make displays larger and more legible.
Limit use, through software, to 3 days.
Test accuracy and safety when using the pump in the highest heat of a desert climate such as Arizona.

Alarms
<p>
These should sound when:<br>

the device is disconnected.<br>
the device is not switched to suspend.Äù<br>
a meal time has passed and no bolus was recorded.<br>
Activate is not used for an intended bolus.<br>
the device needs to be reset<br>
